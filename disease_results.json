  "disease": "Late blight",
  "plant": "Tomato",
  "symptoms": "Late blight on tomatoes manifests as irregular, water-soaked leaf spots rapidly turning brown/black, often with white, fuzzy growth, and firm, brown fruit lesions.",
  "remedies": "Prune infected leaves promptly and dispose of them properly. Apply copper-based fungicides preventatively, following label instructions. Use chlorothalonil or mancozeb fungicides if copper is ineffective. Ensure good air circulation by spacing plants adequately. Remove and destroy all tomato and potato debris at the end of the season. Water plants at the base to avoid wetting foliage. Apply a baking soda spray (1 tsp per quart of water) as a preventative measure. Choose late blight-resistant tomato varieties when available. Monitor plants regularly for early signs of the disease. Improve soil drainage to reduce moisture around plants.",
